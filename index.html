														<p><strong>Chris is a great coach.</strong> He helped me to learn how to focus on the right things, the things that I have the power to change or influence. I’ve been much more successful in my department due to my interaction with Chris.</p>
														<p><strong>Chris also helped me gain skills that I was able to carry over into my personal life.</strong> These skills have helped me to focus on the things that are most important to me.</p>

														<p><strong>Chris is an excellent coach and motivator.</strong>He listens extremely well. What I like most when talking to Chris is that he goes beyond the day to day challenges at home and on the job and makes sure that I’m also moving in a  direction that helps achieve my longer term dreams and aspirations. <strong>He doesn’t ignore the day to day challenges, but helps frame them in the context of the ‘big picture’ and what really matters in life.</strong> He then helps identify actions I can take that continue to move me in the right direction.</p>

														<p><strong>Chris has given direction to my musings, definition to my desires, processes to my thoughts and goals to my wishes.</strong> That to say I am a much better person, leader, father, and husband because of the influence Chris has had on my life. He has always spoken truth whether easy or difficult and I appreciate that along with his wisdom and concerns.  I would endorse Chris and recommend him to anyone looking for someone to help them navigate through life's challenges and successes. </p>

															<p>I continue to be amazed at the power of bringing clarity into our lives.  As I coach, and as I reflect myself on my own life, we seem to have many vague thoughts, hopes, and dreams in our lives.

															<p>I was recently challenged at a John Maxwell Team event to not “read myself into the stories” that others are sharing with me (tell them about my experience on the subject they have surfaced).  Sharing about my experience on the topic has come so naturally and I thought that this was the perfect way to create a good connection with others. <a href="http://cwarnky.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/reading-myself-into-the-stories-of-others/">>> continue reading</a></p>
