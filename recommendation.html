          <p>Chris is an excellent coach and motivator.  He listens extremely well.   What I like most when talking to Chris is that he goes beyond the day to day challenges at home and on the job and makes sure that I’m also moving in a direction that helps achieve my longer term dreams and aspirations.  He doesn’t ignore the day to day challenges, but helps frame them in the context of the ‘big picture’ and what really matters in life.  He then helps identify actions I can take that continue to move me in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Chris is a great coach. He helped me to learn how to focus on the right things, the things that I have the power to change or influence. I’ve been much more successful in my department due to my interaction with Chris. Chris also helped me gain skills that I was able to carry over into my personal life. These skills have helped me to focus on the things that are most important to me. </P>

            <p>He has always spoken truth whether easy or difficult and I appreciate that along with his wisdom and concerns. I would endorse Chris and recommend him to anyone looking for someone to help them navigate through life's challenges and successes.

          <p>Chris has helped me to reframe things to clarify my goals while helping me to map them out.   Everything Chris said to me was so encouraging.  He always asks the right questions that tap into my soul and helped me to see my life's work and mission more clearly.  To have someone to discuss my goals and to help me along the way is awesome. Chris is the perfect life coach. He truly makes a difference in my life.  Learning from his strategies for leading a happier and more productive life is a blessing and I can’t wait to see what wonderful positive improvements and changes in life are going to continuing coming. </P>

          <p>He recognized that other parts of one’s life overlaps and he always took time to listen and showed genuine interest and concern about other life events. 
 </p>
 <p>He knew the right things to say to help me work my way through a difficult situation. He gave advice but always allowed me to work through situations so I grew and learned from the process. </p>
 <p>Chris is one of the most well read and practical people I know, he leads by example and by action.  He is a person of integrity, and always seeks to do the right thing even when it is not in his own best interest. </p>
 <p>

He has always been available to listen when I needed a friend and I still look up to him as a model of how one should live one’s life

Wow, I think you would be a great Life Coach.  You always had a great way of helping me step away from the problem, and look at it from a different perspective.  I still hear your voice in my head as I practice these pearls of wisdom.
