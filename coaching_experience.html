                  <h3> What A Coach Experience Looks Like:</h3>
                  <ul>
                        <li>1.  An initial client inquiry or referral occurs.</li>
                        <li>2.  A short introduction/question and answer session is conducted with the client and coach, usually by phone.</li>
                        <li>3.  A Coach – Client Relationship Discovery Session is conducted to better understand the benefits of having a Coach and the requirements for the partnership. The coach and client decide together if this is a partnership they want to pursue.</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li> When there is a decision to proceed, a Coach - Client Relationship Covenant is completed to establish well defined commitments and boundaries for the relationship. It is discussed, completed, and signed by both of the client and coach during the first session.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>4.  The Client establishes a target goal with the support of the coach.</li>
                        <li>5.  The Client and Coach meet regularly, normally weekly or bi-weekly, for several months either by phone, Skype, or in person.</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li> The sessions are Client focused, anticipating that at least 80% of the conversation comes from the client, stemming from questions from the Coach.</li>
                          <li>The client drives each of these sessions: clearly describing the vision or goal, providing an update on action items, defining the agenda for each session, and defining the desired action items for the next session.</li>
                          <li> Sessions focus on better defining the details of a goal or dream, identifying obstacles and options, and then on defining and taking action steps between sessions.  </li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>6.  The relationship ends either at the end of the agreed time in the Coach – Client Covenant, or before if either the client or the coach feel the partnership is not benefiting the client.</li>
                        <li>7.  Following the completion of the time period defined in the Coach – Client Covenant, if there is interest in continuing the relationship, a new Coach – Client Covenant is completed and the relationship continues.</li>
                      </ul>

                        <li>5.  Discovery conversation: describe, picture, options, obstacles, etc.</li>
                        <li>6.  Client defines Action Items to take for next session</li>
                        <li>7.  Coach ask for anything else to be covered in this session</li>

                        <li>I look forward to meeting with you to talk about Coaching, your situation, and whether or not both of us feel a potential Coach relationship would be helpful to you for moving forward with your life. </li>

                       <p><strong>* My Approach:</p></strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>My services are available to all people with various religious beliefs.  I am a Christian and will approach my coaching from a Biblical perspective, believing that God is our Creator, loves us, has a plan or call for us, and calls us to be good and faithful stewards of all he has provided to us.  This is who I am and it does influence my coaching approach.</li>
